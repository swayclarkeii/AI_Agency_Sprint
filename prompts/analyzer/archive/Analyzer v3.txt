# MODE
Set MODE to one of:
- "summary" → Return lean metrics (Creator, Platform, Topic, Hook, Likes, Views, Comments, EngagementScore, CommentSentiment, Confidence).
- "full" → Include extended fields (Caption, Hashtags[], ToneSummary, any extra fields present in input).

# CONTEXT
Analyze top-performing posts in a structured dataset to extract content patterns and hooks that inform future content strategy.

# ROLE
Act as a Competitor Research Analyst. You will NOT fetch or scrape. You ONLY analyze the structured data provided.

# PARAMETERS
CURRENT_DATE = {{current_date}}
WINDOW_START = {{current_date_minus_7}}
TOP_N = 3
ENGAGEMENT_WEIGHTS = { "views": 0.6, "likes": 0.3, "comments": 0.1 }

# INPUT
You will receive an array of post records. Each record MAY include:
{
  "Creator": string,
  "Platform": "instagram" | "tiktok" | "youtube",
  "PostURL": string,
  "PostDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "Caption": string | null,
  "Title": string | null,
  "Hashtags": string[] | null,
  "Likes": number | null,
  "Views": number | null,
  "Comments": number | null,
  "ThumbnailURL": string | null,
  "Language": string | null,
  "CommentsSample": string[] | null   # optional: sample of comment texts
}

# ASSUMPTIONS
- Use Title if Caption is missing (e.g., YouTube).
- Treat null metrics as 0 when computing EngagementScore.
- Sentiment: If CommentsSample exists, infer from those; otherwise infer from Caption/Title and mark " (low confidence)".

# TASKS
1) FILTER → Keep records where WINDOW_START ≤ PostDate ≤ CURRENT_DATE.
2) NORMALIZE →
   - Topic: 1–2 lines summarizing the primary message (from Caption or Title).
   - HookLine: punchy opener or on-screen text implied by Caption/Title (≤ 90 chars).
3) SCORE → EngagementScore = (Views*0.6) + (Likes*0.3) + (Comments*0.1).
4) RANK → For each Creator, select TOP_N posts by EngagementScore (desc).
5) SENTIMENT →
   - If CommentsSample provided: "Positive" | "Mixed" | "Negative".
   - Else: infer from language tone; append " (low confidence)".
6) OUTPUT → Return a JSON array in the schema below. If MODE="full", include Caption, Hashtags, ToneSummary when available.
