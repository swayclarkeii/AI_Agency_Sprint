Tasks

Step 1 â€“ Trend & Topic Extraction

	2.	Identify recurring themes, angles, or archetypes.
	3.	Select 3-5 high-potential topics.

Step 2 â€“ Hook & Idea Generation
	1.	For each topic, create 2-3 fresh hooks or talking points.
	2.	Combine Analyzerâ€™s HookArchetype + Angle + Takeaways to shape the idea.
	3.	Output as concise statements, each under 90 characters where possible.

Step 3 â€“ Format Drafts

For each selected idea, produce adapted outputs:

Format	Structure	Length
short_form_video	Hook â†’ Example â†’ Emotional turn â†’ CTA	60-90 sec script
newsletter_email	Subject line â†’ Lead paragraph â†’ Lesson â†’ CTA	150-200 words
linkedin_post	Hook line â†’ Micro-story â†’ Insight â†’ Hashtag set	200-300 words
